# 🔧 PWA Cache Issue - Fixed

## 🐛 The Problem

When you ran the production build earlier (`npm run build && npm start`), the PWA service worker was registered in your browser and started caching:
- API responses (5 minutes)
- Images (7 days with CacheFirst)
- Next.js optimized images

Even after switching back to development mode, the service worker remained active and was serving stale cached data, causing:
- ✗ Featured services to disappear after navigation
- ✗ Images not loading on return visits
- ✗ Blank screens on previously visited pages

## ✅ The Fix

### 1. Clear Current Service Worker (Do This Now)

**Option A: Visit the cleanup page**
1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/unregister-sw.html
2. Click "Clear Service Worker"
3. Wait for confirmation
4. You'll be redirected automatically

**Option B: Manual cleanup**
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to **Application** tab
3. **Service Workers** → Click "Unregister"
4. **Storage** → Click "Clear site data"
5. Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R

### 2. Updated PWA Configuration

I've fixed the caching strategies in `next.config.ts`:

**Before (Too Aggressive):**
```typescript
// Images: CacheFirst → Never checked network for updates
handler: 'CacheFirst',
maxAgeSeconds: 60 * 60 * 24 * 7, // 7 days

// API: NetworkFirst with 10s timeout → Fell back to stale cache
networkTimeoutSeconds: 10,
maxAgeSeconds: 60 * 5, // 5 minutes
```

**After (Balanced):**
```typescript
// Images: StaleWhileRevalidate → Serves from cache, updates in background
handler: 'StaleWhileRevalidate',
maxAgeSeconds: 60 * 60 * 24, // 1 day

// Next.js images: Special handling for optimized images
urlPattern: /^\/_next\/image\?url=.*/i,
handler: 'StaleWhileRevalidate',

// API: NetworkFirst with 3s timeout → Less likely to use stale cache
networkTimeoutSeconds: 3,
maxAgeSeconds: 60 * 2, // 2 minutes
```

**Key Changes:**
1. ✅ Images use `StaleWhileRevalidate` instead of `CacheFirst`
2. ✅ Added special handling for Next.js optimized images
3. ✅ Reduced image cache from 7 days to 1 day
4. ✅ Reduced API cache from 5 minutes to 2 minutes
5. ✅ Reduced network timeout from 10s to 3s
6. ✅ Added comments explaining each caching strategy

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### StaleWhileRevalidate Strategy:
1. User requests image/page
2. Service worker serves from cache immediately (fast!)
3. **In background**, fetches from network
4. Updates cache with fresh version
5. Next visit gets the updated version

### NetworkFirst Strategy (API):
1. Try network first (3-second timeout)
2. If network fails or times out → Use cache
3. Cache expires after 2 minutes
4. Always fresh data (unless offline)

## 🧪 Testing After Fix

1. ✅ Clear service worker (use method above)
2. ✅ Restart dev server
3. ✅ Navigate to home page → Featured services should load
4. ✅ Go to another page → Navigate back → Images should still be there
5. ✅ Check DevTools Console → No service worker errors

## 📝 Important Notes

### Development Mode:
- PWA is **disabled** in development (`npm run dev`)
- No service worker should register
- No caching happens

### Production Mode:
- PWA is **enabled** in production (`npm run build && npm start`)
- Service worker registers and caches resources
- Use the new improved caching strategies

### Future Builds:
When you build for production again:
- The new caching strategies will apply
- Images will update in the background
- API responses stay fresh (2-minute cache)
- No more blank screens!

## 🚀 Prevention

To avoid this issue in the future:

1. **Always clear service worker** after testing production builds:
   ```
   Visit: http://localhost:3000/unregister-sw.html
   ```

2. **Use incognito mode** for production testing (no cache persistence)

3. **Check Application tab** in DevTools before reporting bugs:
   - Look for active service workers
   - Check cache storage
   - Clear if needed

## ✅ Checklist

Before continuing development:
- [ ] Visit http://localhost:3000/unregister-sw.html and clear SW
- [ ] Restart dev server (`npm run dev`)
- [ ] Test navigation (home → other page → back to home)
- [ ] Verify images load correctly
- [ ] Check no service worker is active (DevTools → Application → Service Workers)

**Status:** ✅ Fixed  
**Action Required:** Clear service worker using methods above  
**Next Build:** Will use improved caching strategies
